      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of the site is to promote healthy home eating. Here, 
          people should be able to view various recipes and menus, and place 
          an order for food delivery for their chosen dishes. The main page 
          of the site should be for informational purposes - to attract 
          visitors to a closer acquaintance with the company. Also, the site 
          should support the ability to post new recipes so that customers 
          have the opportunity to try new things. The site should demonstrate 
          all the benefits of healthy nutrition as a basis for our health.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The target audience of the site is housewives who want to diversify 
          the menu, while spending a minimum of time on it. Our clients are 
          people who are tired of the monotony or want to improve their 
          eating habits, and also want to avoid the fuss in order to achieve 
          their goal. They want to make their choice quickly and go back to 
          just cooking and be sure that the work of collecting and delivering 
          products will be done quickly and efficiently.</p>  <!-- change this -->
