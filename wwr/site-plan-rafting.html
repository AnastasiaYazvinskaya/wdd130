            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>The purpose of the site is to acquaint the target audience with such kind of entertainment as 
                rafting. As well as attracting new people to participate in trips along various rivers. The main 
                page of the site should be of an introductory nature - to attract visitors to a closer acquaintance 
                with the company. Also, the site should support the possibility of posting posts from the rafting 
                organizers about past trips with photos, so that customers better understand the essence of tourism. 
                The site should demonstrate all the advantages of rafting as a unity with nature and other people.</p>

            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>The target audience of the site is people aged 16 and older who are interested in a change of scenery 
                and getting out of their comfort zone. Visitors should have a desire to try something new in life 
                and maybe take a chance. Water rafting can also be an opportunity to bring family, friends and 
                colleagues together. A possible need of the clients may be a unity with nature or a sense of the 
                wild, which provides this type of tourism without harsh conditions. Since the age range of clients 
                is wide, the site must be accessible from various types of devices: computer, mobile phone or tablet.</p>
